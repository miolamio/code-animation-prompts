# Bold-outline Sticker Explainer MG (PaperClip / Lin Chao style)

**Original video**: How Many Elements Are Hiding in One Phone? 70/118 · 1920×1080 · 30 fps · 10 s · final AI review score 7.71 / 10

**Source code**: [demos/19-paperclip/](../demos/19-paperclip/)

## How to use

1. Create a new empty folder and open an AI assistant in it that can write code and run commands (for example Claude Code). Your machine needs to be able to render web pages (Node + Chrome) and run ffmpeg.
2. Copy the entire "Prompt" below into it and send.
3. To use your own content: change the story, brand name, copy and color palette in `Creative seed`, or the dimensions in `Output` (for example vertical format 1080×1920). Do not delete the `Signature features` section; it is what makes this style instantly recognizable.
4. To improve further: once the final video is out, open a separate AI to review it with [rubric.md](../rubric.md), then paste the review back to the AI that made it for another round. The original video went through two such rounds.

## Prompt

```text
You are the director, motion designer, engineer and sound designer of ONE 10-second motion-design film.
The goal is the most classic, yet most stunning form of this style — award-shortlist / high-end commercial quality. A clean,
template-looking result is a fail. Benchmarks: Buck, ManvsMachine, Ordinary Folk, Giant Ant, Territory Studio, Apple keynote
motion, Pentagram motion identities, top Behance/Motionographer features, top Douyin/Bilibili designer accounts.

# Style
Bold-outline Sticker Explainer MG (PaperClip / Lin Chao style)

# Output (fixed)
- 1920×1080, 30 fps, exactly 10.000 s (300 frames), H.264 MP4 with stereo AAC audio (48 kHz), mastered to −14 LUFS
  integrated, true peak ≤ −1 dBTP. Final file: video.mp4.

# Suggested technical route
HTML: one huge canvas (e.g. 6000×3000 px) with a camera transform (long eases), SVG charts, photo stickers with 10px white outline
(You may choose a better route if it clearly raises quality; say why.)

# Creative seed
"PaperClip-Style Hardcore Science Explainer": The PaperClip-style knowledge-video look: sticker-ized photos + flat icons + precise charts on a giant canvas with continuous camera moves.
- Topic (write your own tight copy), e.g. "How many elements are hiding in one phone?".
- Calm blue-grey/off-white canvas (#E9EEF2 + slate), 2–3 colours + one accent (e.g. #FF5A36); equal-weight sans typography, strict alignment.
- One continuous camera path: sticker phone photo (white 10px outline, soft shadow) → exploded-parts stickers with leader-line labels → periodic-table grid where element tiles light up → bar chart grows with count-up "70+" → world map with supply routes drawing → pull out to a bold typographic title card in the PaperClip manner (heavy sans, huge number, small caption).
- Every beat introduces a new visual element; charts are exact (bars to scale, numbers consistent).
Sound: clean tech-explainer bed, UI clicks, ticking during count-up, soft whoosh on camera moves.

You are the director: you may change the concept, copy, story beats and brand names if you find a stronger idea, but the result must remain the CANONICAL, instantly-recognisable form of this style and must hit its signature features below.

# Signature features and key techniques (the result is judged against these)
The standard knowledge-video packaging popularized by PaperClip: real photos are cut out and given thick white outlines to become 'stickers', laid out with flat icons and data charts on a big canvas, with the camera panning and zooming to link the information points; finance and interdisciplinary creators such as Lin Chao combine it with handwritten board notes and formula cards. It remains the mainstream template for hardcore science explainers, finance knowledge videos and corporate promos.
Visual features: photos turned into stickers (thick white outline), calm blue-gray/off-white base colors, flat icons + precise data charts, big-canvas camera pans and zooms, beat-driven narration with extremely high information density
Key techniques: cut out source photos + 8~12px white outline for a uniform material feel, eliminating differences in image sources
Ultra-wide big-canvas layout, with the camera layer panning/zooming (long ease curves), one shot linking multiple information points
Chart motion: bar charts growing, numbers rolling up, path outlines growing
Narration drives element entrances sentence by sentence; fast speech, every sentence must bring a new visual element
Restrained palette (2~3 colors) + monoline type, keeping a 'serious' feel

# How to work
1. Treatment. Write down one clear idea: a hook in the first 0.5 s (never open on more than 0.3 s of empty or black), an
   escalation, one unmistakable hero moment at ~60–75 % of the runtime, and a composed end frame held ~0.8–1.2 s with living
   micro-motion. Map every signature feature above to a moment. Keep one cue sheet (beats and hit times) that both the
   picture and the sound read from.
2. Key frames before motion. Build the look, render stills at 6–10 key times and actually look at them. Each still should be
   poster-worthy: composition, hierarchy, negative space, type set properly (kerning, line-height, weight contrast, CJK
   punctuation, ~5 % safe margins). Iterate until nothing looks default, generic, cramped or "AI-template".
3. Motion. Build the choreography and preview at low resolution. Step through the fastest moves frame by frame: spacing,
   easing, arcs, overlap, anticipation and follow-through, motion blur. No unintended dead spans; the energy follows the music.
4. Sound. Write genre-correct music and sound design locked to the cue sheet. Check that visual hits land on audio onsets.
   Master to the output spec.
5. Final. Render at full resolution (motion blur where apt), then check: exactly 10.00 s, resolution, fps, audio present and at
   the right loudness, no black frames, no fallback fonts or tofu, no clipped elements at the frame edges, no shimmer on thin
   lines, no gradient banding. Fix and repeat until you would submit it to a festival.
6. Write an honest self-critique: what is strongest, what is weakest, what you would do with more time.

# Rules
- Rendering must be deterministic: every frame is a pure function of time t. Seeded randomness only; physics and particles
  precomputed or closed-form; no real-time clocks; no state-triggered CSS transitions. A reliable route: a web page that can
  draw any time t on request, captured frame by frame with a headless browser and encoded with ffmpeg (or a Blender script
  that renders a PNG sequence).
- Assets: only CC0 / public domain / OFL / Apache / free-for-commercial-use. Record each source and licence in CREDITS.md.
  No real brand trademarks; invent brand names.
- On-screen text must be correct and natural: idiomatic Chinese, proper CJK punctuation, no typos.

# Craft checklist (what a jury looks for)
- Style authenticity: an expert names the style in one second; every signature technique is present and executed correctly.
- Motion craft: purposeful easing (no linear unless mechanical by design), overlap and stagger, anticipation and
  follow-through, arcs, squash and stretch where the style allows, consistent physics, motion blur where apt; transitions
  carried by elements, not crossfades.
- Rhythm: hits locked to the music; contrast between busy and calm; no monotony.
- Design: strong composition, grid, typographic hierarchy, controlled palette; texture and finishing (grain, glow, vignette)
  only where the style wants it; nothing looks accidental.
- Technical polish: no jitter (unless intended), no popping, no aliasing, no banding, no fallback fonts, no half-loaded images.
- Sound: genre-correct, musical, synced, mastered.

# Before you deliver, score yourself honestly
1–10 on style fidelity, concept wow, motion craft, design & typography, finish & texture, sound & sync, technical
(6 = template-level, 8 = high-end agency, 9 = award shortlist). Aim for 9; fix whatever scores lowest first.

# Deliver
video.mp4, plus a short report: the concept in two sentences; a beat sheet with timecodes; how each signature feature is
realised; the tech route; check numbers (duration, resolution, fps, loudness, true peak); your honest top-3 weaknesses.
